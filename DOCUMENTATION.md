<h1>Agents</h2>

The Agents file contains the classes of all agents involved in the clinic's life process. 

<h2>Base class</h3>

First of all, let's consider the ```BaseAgent``` abstract class, which is the base class for all other classes.

```python
class BaseAgent:
    id = 0
    _surnames = config["NAMES"]["LAST_NAMES"].split(sep=', ')
    _first_names = config["NAMES"]["FIRST_NAMES"].split(sep=', ')

    def __init__(self, role):
        self.id = BaseAgent.id
        BaseAgent.id += 1
        self.role = role
        self.name = " ".join([np.random.choice(self._first_names), np.random.choice(self._surnames)])
```

It has a static ```id``` field, which is shared between all instances of the class and is incremented by 1 when a descendant is initialized.

In addition, ```BaseAgent``` contains two more static fields ```_surnames``` and ```_first_names```, reflecting the available sets of first and last names to generate the full name stored in the ```name``` field and forming a unique combination together with ```id```. The first and last names are not stored directly in the python code, instead we use a configuration file.

The BaseAgent initializer contains a ```role``` variable, which is then assigned to a field of the same name. The ```role`` is what defines the conduct of the agent in the simulator logic. Roles are of 3 types: patient, physician, and intern.

<h3>Field Types</h3>

| Field | Type |
|-------|------|
|```id```|```Int```|
|```role```|```String```|
|```_surnames```|```[String]```|
|```_first_names```|```[String]```|
|```name```|```String```|

<h3>Method Types</h3>

| Method | Input | Output |
|-------|------|------|
|```init()```|```role``` : ```String```|```BaseAgent```|

<h2>Patient</h3>

The ```Patient``` —Ålass reflects a person, with some hidden set of physiological parameters, implicitly expressed by the ```Task``` he or she sets for the doctor to investigate.

```python
class Patient(BaseAgent):

    @staticmethod
    def createTask():
        return Task()

    def choosePhysician(self, pool):
        physician = np.random.choice(pool)
        thread = threading.Thread(target=physician.request_handler, args=(self,))
        thread.start()
        return physician

    def __init__(self, income_time, available_physicians):
        super().__init__(role='Patient')
        self.income_time = income_time
        self.resume_time = None
        self.task = self.createTask()
        self.physician = self.choosePhysician(pool=available_physicians)
```

Once we note that before declaring and initializing with some values the fields of the ```BaseAgent``` descendant class, it is necessary to initialize the parent class, assigning the agent the appropriate role, in this case the role of 'Patient'.

```python
super().__init__(role='Patient')
```

Subsequently, this step will be repeated when initializing the ```Physician``` and ```Intern``` classes.

The patient initializer takes two variables as input: the time the request was received, expressed by the ```income_time``` variable, and the pool of radiology physicians available for selection in the ```available_physicians``` variable. 

The ```task``` field is initialized by an instance of the ```Task``` class. To get the corresponding instance, you need to call the ```CreateTask()``` method. It is assumed that the real life task can be obtained using more complex logic, including using GAN tools to generate the most rare and missing samples of the ```Task``` class.

The ```physician``` field is filled in according to the results of the ```choosePhysician()``` function. This method randomly returns a physician from the list of available physicians and starts a separate subprocess to perform the received objective using the methods of the built-in library ```threading```.

It is important that the argument of the ```physician.request_handler()``` function is directly an instance of the ```Patient``` class, which is reflected in this line.

```python
thread = threading.Thread(target=physician.request_handler, args=(self,))
```

Last, consider the ```resume_time``` field. The field is declared and initialized with a None value. The field is populated after ```physician.request_handler()``` is successfully executed.

<h3>Field Types</h3>

| Field | Type |
|-------|------|
|```income_time```|```datetime```|
|```resime_time```|```None``` / ```datetime```|
|```task```|```Task```|
|```physician```|```Physician```|

<h2>Physician</h3>

The ```Physician``` class describes the basic properties of a radiologist in the agent chain of a multi-agent system.

```python
class Physician(BaseAgent):

    @property
    def workload(self):
        return len(self.pipeline)

    @staticmethod
    def choose_intern(pool):
        return np.random.choice(pool)

    def request_handler(self, request):
        self.assign(request)
        self.solve(request, self.assistants)
        self.release(request)

    def assign(self, objective):
        self.pipeline.append(objective)

    def solve(self, objective, assistants):
        intern = self.choose_intern(assistants)
        result = 0
        latency = timedelta(minutes=0)
        while result == 0:
            outcome = intern.generate_outcome(objective.task)
            result = outcome.result
            if result == 0:
                latency = (timedelta(minutes=outcome.time) +
                           timedelta(minutes=int(np.random.choice([x for x in range(1, 4)]))))
            else:
                latency = (timedelta(minutes=outcome.time) +
                           timedelta(minutes=int(np.random.choice([x for x in range(7, 10)]))))
        objective.resume_time = objective.income_time + latency
        time.sleep(int(latency.total_seconds() / 600))

    def release(self, objective):
        idx = self.pipeline.index(objective)
        self.completed.append(self.pipeline.pop(idx))

    def __init__(self, assistants):
        super().__init__(role='Physician')
        self.qualification = np.random.choice(['Doctor of Medical Sciences',
                                               'Candidate of Medical Sciences',
                                               'Specialist'], p=[0.2, 0.3, 0.5])
        self.assistants = assistants
        self.completed = []
        self.pipeline = []
        self._workload = 0
```

Each radiologist has inherent properties: the degree of medical training, expressed by the variable ```qualification```, and the set of residents with whom he cooperates, expressed by the variable ```assistants```.

When a patient's request is received, the ```request_handler()``` method starts executing, which includes three steps:

 - ```assign()``` - adding the patient to the ```pipeline```;
 - ```solve()``` - reading the MRI image, making a diagnosis and prescribing therapy, in this case, one of the available interns is selected for MRI image markup using the web-based image markup platform developed by us;
 - ```release()``` - extracting the patient from the current ```pipeline``` and adding it to the solved cases expressed by the ``completed`` variable.

The computational field ```workload``` reflects the length of the working ```pipeline``` at the current time. The property can be called at any time to document the state of the agent.

<h3>Field Types</h3>

| Field | Type |
|-------|------|
|```qualification```|```String```|
|```assistants```|```[Intern]```|
|```completed```|```[Patient]```|
|```pipeline```|```[Patitent]```|
|```workload```|```Int```|

<h2>Intern</h3>

Instances of the ```Intern``` class are involved in marking up MRI images for the physician. They are the lowest level of the agent hierarchy, as they cannot manage either patient flow or therapist activity.

```python
class Intern(BaseAgent):

    @property
    def efficiency(self):
        if self.attempts != 0:
            return self.successes / self.attempts
        else:
            return 0.5

    @property
    def successes(self):
        return len([x for x in self.outcomes if x.result == 1])

    @property
    def attempts(self):
        return len(self.outcomes)

    def generate_outcome(self, task):
        if task.intricate:
            result = Result(success_rate=self.success_rate * .8,
                            mean_time=self.mean_time * 2, std=self.deviation)
            self.outcomes.append(result)
            return result
        else:
            result = Result(success_rate=self.success_rate,
                            mean_time=self.mean_time, std=self.deviation)
            self.outcomes.append(result)
            return result

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(role='Intern')
        self.success_rate = np.random.choice([x / 10 for x in range(6, 10, 1)], p=[0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.2])
        self.mean_time = np.random.choice(range(8, 14, 2))
        self.deviation = np.random.choice([x / 10 for x in range(5, 20, 5)])
        self.outcomes = []
        self._attempts = 0
        self._successes = 0
        self._efficiency = 0.5
```

Instances of the ```Physician``` class use the ```generate_outcome(self, task)``` method of the assisting instances of the ```Intern``` class to produce a simulation of the result of MRI image markup. The result can be either satisfactory, in which case the doctor spends some extra time analyzing the image, or unsatisfactory, in which case the doctor still spends some time analyzing the image and then sends the job for redoing. In either case, the result is written to history, forming an array of ```outcomes```. The intern's work is not considered complete until a senior physician accepts it (hierarchical criterion).

The ```Intern``` class has several computational properties:
 - ```efficiency``` - returns the absolute efficiency of the intern;
 - ```successes``` - returns the number of tasks successfully solved by the intern;
 - ```attempts``` - returns the number of all attempts made (length of ```outcomes```).

Knowing successes and attempts one can calculate the relative efficiency of the intern in narrow profile tasks, such as abdominal or musculoskeletal radiology. At the moment of cold start, the efficiency of each intern in the network equates to 0.5.

In addition to explicitly defined attributes, each intern is characterized by a set of impicit parameters, such as ```success_rate``` - a real chance of successfully completing the task depending on the quality of training, ```mean_time``` and ```deviation``` - average time to complete the task and spread.

<h3>Field Types</h3>

| Field | Type |
|-------|------|
|```success_rate```|```Double```|
|```mean_time```|```Int```|
|```deviation```|```Double```|
|```outcomes```|```[Result]```|
|```attempts```|```Int```|
|```successes```|```Int```|
|```efficiency```|```Double```|

<h2>Task</h2>

The ```Task``` class describes the clinical case of a patient.

```python
class Task:
    def __init__(self):
        self.urgency = np.random.choice([1, 2, 3], p=[0.6, 0.3, 0.1])
        self.intricate = np.random.choice([True, False], p=[0.3, 0.7])
```

The ```Task``` class contains two fields:
- ```urgency``` - field describes urgency on a scale from 1 to 3, where 1 is an urgent task (hospitalisation, severe condition), 2 is a task of medium urgency (the patient is conscious, injuries of no more than medium severity), 3 is the lowest priority (regular examinations, monitoring, minor injuries);
- ```intricacy``` - binary variable, either the task requires the highest qualification (1) of a specialist or it does not (0).

<h3>Field Types</h3>

| Field | Type |
|-------|------|
|```urgency```|```Int```|
|```intricate```|```Int```|

<h2>Result</h2>

The ```Result``` class describes the degree of success of the task performed by the intern to mark up the snapshot.

```python
class Result:
    def __init__(self, success_rate, mean_time, std):
        self.result = np.random.choice([0, 1], p=[1 - success_rate, success_rate])
        self.time = np.random.normal(mean_time, std)
```

The ```Result``` class contains two fields:
- ```result``` - binary variable, either is unsatisfactory (0), or is satisfactory (1);
- ```time``` - number of minutes spent on the task.
Note that here and everywhere time is estimated in minutes, however, for real-time simulation, a value in minutes divided by 10 is used.

| Field | Type |
|-------|------|
|```result```|```Int```|
|```time```|```Double```|
